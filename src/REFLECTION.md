# Project Reflection: Quote Generator

This project was more than just building a quote generator, it was a hands-on learning experience that helped me grow as a developer and designer. I wanted to create something simple, motivational, and visually clean and I’m proud of how it turned out.

## What I Learned

-React fundamentals: As a complete beginner, it took me quite a few days to grasp the core concepts like components, props, and state. I spent time practicing and experimenting before I even touched this project.
- Vite setup: I learned how to scaffold a project from scratch using Vite and configure it for development.
- Responsive design: I used media queries and flexible containers to make sure the layout works on both desktop and mobile.
- Favicon and manifest: I added multi-size favicons and a web manifest to give the app a polished, professional feel.
- Clipboard API: I implemented a copy to clipboard feature using plain JavaScript a small but satisfying win.
- Git workflow: I practiced writing clear, progress oriented commit messages and organizing my files properly.


## Design Choices

I was inspired by the clean aesthetic of apps I use every day on my PC and phone. I wanted the interface to feel calm, uncluttered, and easy to use. No distractions, just the quote and a couple of buttons. I kept the CSS simple and easy to understand, avoiding advanced tricks or code that didn’t feel like ME.


## hallenges I Faced

- Getting the favicon to show up took some trial and error, I had to learn about browser caching and file placement.
- I had to troubleshoot file structure issues, especially with `main.jsx` and the `public/` folder.
- I made sure the layout and styling stayed beginner friendly and readable.
- I also made sure to keep the design clean and intuitive, you know what they say. "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication".


## Final Thoughts

This project reflects my learning journey, not just the final result, but the process of figuring things out, testing, breaking, and fixing. I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited to keep building things that feel like mine.
