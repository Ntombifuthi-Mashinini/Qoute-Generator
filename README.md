## Design Inspiration

This project is inspired by the clean, minimalist aesthetic found in many of the apps I use on both my PC and phone. I wanted the quote generator to feel familiar, uncluttered, and visually calming something that reflects my personal style and the kind of digital spaces I enjoy. The layout, colors, and interactions are intentionally simple to keep the focus on the message and make the experience approachable for everyone.
